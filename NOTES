randomness does not need to be the only way that the artist cedes their control in the generative art process.



it would eb cool to have my own exhcange, which i then whitelist all my NFTs, and use that pricing data as input



ENS name should be associated with the token

should team up with rafael and do some web-based stuff.
he would actually  be a good person to team up with. i should get lunch with him and talk about if maybe we could use a shared infrastructure for website NFTs



Should sell disclaimer art



should make a stablecoin based on fastcash
  - fastcash central bank is overcollateralized -- the website says that it's worth 45.5 ETH each
  - if run on bank, sell FASTCASH at 45 ETH (Arbitrage opportunity)
  - shares of the FASTCASH Reserve are fracitonalized, turned into tokens
    - you can stake those tokens to get a 10% return week over week
